# robo-friends
A frontend app, done using React.js and Redux.js, containing some robot cards and a search field.

To run the app:

- clone this repository

- npm install

- npm start

The app illustrates how state management is done using Redux. To get robot images and info I used JSONPlacholder and RoboHash APIs. You can search through the robot names by typing into the search field.
